# Papers

📑  A repository for writing and collaborating on $LaTeX$ papers since [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) reduced the compile timeout for free plan to only 10 seconds.

You can find a tutorial on how to use $LaTeX$ locally and how to collaborate on paper writing with GitHub [here](https://github.com/capibara3/.github-private/blob/main/tutorials/00_index.md).

## Writing Papers on GitHub

> 🚨 Please, don't edit or push files into the main branch. Create a branch with you name/github username to make edits on your computer and then create a pull request from your branch to the main one. After a review (which you *have to* request to the latest person that edited that section and the principal author of the paper) you main merge the PR into the main branch. Don't delete your branch by that time, because you will reuse it for further edits. Thank you!
