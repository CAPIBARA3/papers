# Papers

📑  A repository for writing and collaborating on $LaTeX$ papers since [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) reduced the compile timeout for free plan to only 10 seconds.

You can find a tutorial on how to use $LaTeX$ locally and how to collaborate on paper writing with GitHub [here](https://github.com/capibara3/.github-private/blob/main/tutorials/00_index.md).
