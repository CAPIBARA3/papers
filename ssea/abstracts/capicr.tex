\begin{abstract}
Cosmic Rays (CRs), or cosmic radiation, are charged particles originating from outer space with extremely high energy due to their relativistic velocities. These particles are mainly protons (~87%) and Helium nuclei (~10%), and they provide key insights in the astrophysics field. However, Earth’s atmosphere prevents most high-energy photons (X-rays and γ-rays) and primary cosmic rays from reaching the surface. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, we aim to develop a compact cosmic ray detector (the CAPICR instrument), which will be sent to a Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

The mission’s main goal is to study the flux and energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays. To achieve this, CAPICR’s detection system will consist of a plastic scintillator, a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), and an integrated circuit. The principle of operation is simple: when a high-energy particle passes through the scintillator, it will emit photons, which will be collected by the SiPM, and detected as a voltage pulse in the electronic circuit. To protect all these elements, they will be contained in a 3D-printed metallic enclosure, which, thanks to its intrinsic properties, enhances photon collection efficiency by redirecting the photons toward the SiPM. Afterwards, the detector will be integrated into the OBA FARADAY CubeSat satellite. 

Beyond the scientific goals, this mission also aims to serve an educational purpose. By generating open scientific data, we aim to promote student participation in the scientific world, as well as highlight the importance of cooperation between institutions and individuals.
